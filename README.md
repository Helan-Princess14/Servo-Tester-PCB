# Servo-Tester-PCB
Designed a single-layer, through-hole PCB for a servo tester using KiCad. Developed schematics, layout, and Gerber files for professional fabrication, enabling precise manual adjustment and testing of RC servo motors. Strengthened PCB design and prototyping skills.

I designed a Servo Motor Tester PCB in KiCad üõ†Ô∏è. From schematic design to generating Gerber files, and finally making it a single-layer through-hole board, this project gave me hands-on exposure to the complete PCB design flow.

It was a great learning experience in bridging design ‚Üí fabrication ‚Üí testing, and I really enjoyed the process of bringing a circuit from software to hardware.

Looking forward to taking up more such projects and exploring advanced PCB designs! ‚ú®
